AJZ (not Alex) Wish list, as of January 3, 2024. Go
[here](/birthday-party/list-kid.html) for Alex list.

# High priority

These are things I would start using right away and keep using a lot,
possibly daily.

- **Necktie,** solid green, black, grey, brown. Made of silk. Get
  "skinny" style, like 2 inches wide, without much "tapering" as it
  goes from the bottom to the top. Possibly with a blunt,
  rectangle-type end, instead of coming to a point.

- **Tie clip,** a cool, classy style, so my tie doesn't flop forward
  and drag on things if I bend over. Doesn't have to be literally made
  of a precious metal. Don't get the kind with a pin that pierces
  through things. Style ideas: fun but subtle pattern, texture, my
  monogram, anchor, key, rod of Asclepius, frieze pattern (do an image
  search for 'frieze pattern').

- Footwear, size 10

    - **Shoes** for work/office. Dark brown leather. Slip on. Size 10.
      Mostly dressy. Could be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing
      that I would shop for myself).

    - **Shoes,** lace up. Style: oxford, brogue, or blucher.
      Surprisingly, it has been years since I owned a lace-up pair of
      work shoes.

    - **Casual shoes** like these styles by
      [Allbirds](https://www.allbirds.com): Tree Dasher, Tree Runners,
      Tree Pipers, Tree Skippers, Canvas Pacers. Any color *except*
      orange, yellow, purple, pink, white. Or just send me to their
      store in our neighborhood.

    - Gift certificate to tecovas.com or their brick and mortar store?
      (Boots)

- Any battery-powered **wristwatch** with hands (not digital numbers),
  with a chronograph (stopwatch) built-in. Seiko or Timex are
  reasonable. Not fancy.

- **Old-timey "straight key"** for Morse code. Search ebay for "navy
  flameproof" or "vintage straight key." J-38 key is another classic
  style. Ideally get one that has all or most of the parts. (Don't buy
  just the knob, or a key without the knob. Key and knob without the
  base is okay. Without wires is pretty much okay.) These are fun
  gifts because it almost doesn't matter what kind you buy. They are
  all different, and they all will work and be interesting to try!

- **Single lever paddle** for Morse code.

    - search [gigaparts.com](https://www.gigaparts.com) for "single
      paddle", about $43.
    
    - Bencher ST-1. $150. [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com). This
      is supposedly a lovely one to use.
    
    - Vibrokeyer Standard. $180. [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com)
    
    - Begali "simplex mono basic" or "simplex mono",
      [i2rtf.com](https://i2rtf.com). These are pricey.




## High priority but already on Amazon list

All items on the Amazon list are "approved by me" and look like they
would work, if you are not sure about buying the "right" thing from
the list above.

- **NanoVNA antenna analyzer.** This lets me see how well radio
  antennas are set up, especially small, temporary ones.

- **GMRS handheld radios.** Search for "UV-5G" or "UV-5R GMRS." Lets
  several people in one family share one license to talk on certain
  frequencies.

- Any of the **Kindle books** on that list. Completely fine to get any
  of these as a paper book, too (including used)!




# Medium priority

Many of these are very fun, but either I don't "need" them, or I would
use them but not all that often. I would be very happy to receive any
of them!

- **Jaguar XK8**, but not the real car, a scale model :). Preferably
  green. Possibly one of the "display" models that's die cast, like
  those made by Maisto. Or literally a Hot Wheels. ![example of Jaguar model car](/birthday-party/jaguar.jpg)

- Nintendo Switch?? Around $300.

- Any **short sleeve shirt from Criquet**,
  [criquetshirts.com](https://criquetshirts.com), around $90. Size:
  medium. Now *free shipping* on all orders with code: FALLSHIP

- **Sandals**: slightly dressy, for outdoors, similar to my current
  ones, which are from L.L. Bean. Dark leather strap. No strap on the
  heel. The kind that go between big toe and 2nd toe, *not* the kind
  that go all the way over the instep. See example: ![example of flip-flops I like](/birthday-party/flipflop.jpg)

- Some kind of short sleeve **polo shirt**, *not* all-cotton,
  lightweight. Probably solid color. OK brands: Izod, Under Armour,
  Adidas. The kind I like are often sold as "golf performance wicking
  something something."

- **Short sleeve button-front** shirt, casual, all cotton.

- New **belt**. Brown or black leather, for work. simple design
  without a lot of stitching or decoration. strap has to be 36 inches
  to fit correctly with enough leeway.

- **Belt**, casual. Has to be **lightweight** (no heavy metal buckle,
  no wide or thick leather). Any material for the strap is OK. Mostly
  for wearing with shorts. Lots more colors and designs are
  acceptable.

- Tan/khaki colored Levi 501 or 505 **jeans**, waist 34, length 30 (yes).
  Alternate colors: dark grey, dark olive, brown.

- **Fix up bass guitar.** The middle potentiometer has always been
  weird and turns too far around. Some things seem intermittently not
  connected to the right pickups. Pay for somebody to check and repair
  (Rockin' Robin on Greenbriar in Houston is pretty close to us).
  Include: cheap soft "gig bag" for bass, probably $30--40.

- Some kind of **loop gizmo** for music. The idea is, I record one
  instrument bit, the machine plays it through a speaker, and then I
  play something along on a different instrument. Maybe what's called
  a "looper pedal" but I'm not sure. Got to be self-contained and as
  simple as possible (if I have to break out my laptop each time and
  connect it, I will never use it). Maybe speaker included? Should be
  able to record several minutes if needed.

- Probably too crazy of an idea, but: Banjo ukulele? Mandolin? Bass clarinet?

- [https://www.danperri.com/book](https://www.danperri.com/book): an
  interesting-looking book from a famous movie title designer

- **QCX-mini kit**, which is a little tiny radio that you build. Get
  it for the **40m band**. $55. Yes, the kit, not the assembled
  version. [qrp-labs.com](https://qrp-labs.com)

- Radio **antenna,** MFJ-1982MP. This lets me talk on some frequencies
  that I have never used so far, and it can be easily taken somewhere,
  set up temporarily, and taken down again. $100 on
  [mfjenterprises.com](https://mfjenterprises.com)

- **Semi-automatic "bug" Morse code key.** Such as vibroplex original
  standard. $220. [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com)

- **Men's suit.** Could be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing
  that I would shop for myself but am not sure where)

- I slightly want a **bike with electric assist motor.** *Consumer
  Reports* has a list that I can show you. [Example

- Book, *Clinical Research Informatics* Third Edition, edited by
  Richesson, Andrews, and Hollis. [publisher

- Cuisinart Cleanburn Firepit, $250.

- DeWalt pressure washer, $300. Like model DWPW2100
