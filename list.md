# AJZ (not Alex) Wish List

As of June 5, 2025

- Go [here](/birthday-party/list-kid.html) for Alex list.
- Go [here](/birthday-party/list-eam.html) for E.A.M. list.



# High priority

These are things I would start using right away and keep using a lot,
possibly daily. Arranged in no particular order inside this section.

- **Photo developing** of several rolls of 35mm film! I think [Indie
  Film Lab](https://www.indiefilmlab.com/) looks good. I would get
  *Process & Scan,* C41, 35mm, Noritsu scanner, resolution L, change
  to Uncorrected, file type JPG. This is $12 per roll. (I have 6 rolls
  to do.)

- **Trip to [Lone Star Flight Museum](https://lonestarflight.org/),**
  or if you're feeling fancy, a ride in one of their historic
  airplanes.

- **The ARRL Antenna Book, 25th edition,** hardcover. The version that
  comes all as one volume (not softcover, not 4-volume set). $80. Main
  ARRL store link [here](https://home.arrl.org/action/Shop/Store).
  Direct [link to Antenna
  Book](https://home.arrl.org/action/Store/Product-Details/productId/2012451093).
  For some reason hardcover no longer available?

- **Necktie or bowtie with repeating pattern of small logos**.
    Preferably made of silk, and with embroidered logos, but those
    aren't requirements. Logos of any of the following schools:
    - Spartan helmet for MSU: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/msu.jpg" alt="MSU tie" width="100"/>
    - Block S letter for MSU.
    - The shield logo for Washington University in St. Louis: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/wu.jpg" alt="WUStL tie" width="100"/>
    - Block H letter for Harvard (sometimes inside a shield, technically their athletic logo).
    - Plain "Veritas" shield for Harvard: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hu-b1.jpg" alt="Harvard bowtie" width="100"/> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hu-b2.jpg" alt="Harvard bowtie, striped" width="100"/> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hu-n1.jpg" alt="Harvard tie, striped" width="100"/> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hu-n2.jpg" alt="Harvard tie" width="100"/>
    - Shield with lion rampant for Harvard medical: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hm-b.jpg" alt="HMS bowtie" width="100"/> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hm-n.jpg" alt="HMS tie" width="100"/>

- **Necktie,** solid green, black, grey, brown. Made of silk. Get
  "skinny" style, like 2 inches wide, without much "tapering" as it
  goes from the bottom to the top. Possibly with a blunt,
  rectangle-type end, instead of coming to a point.

- **Tie clip,** a cool, classy style, so my tie doesn't flop forward
  and drag on things if I bend over. Doesn't have to be literally made
  of a precious metal. Don't get the kind with a pin that pierces
  through things. Style ideas: fun but subtle pattern, texture, my
  monogram, anchor, key, rod of Asclepius, frieze pattern (do an image
  search for 'frieze pattern').

- Footwear, size 10

    - **Shoes** for work/office. Dark brown leather. Slip on. Size 10.
      Mostly dressy. Could be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing
      that I would shop for myself).

    - **Shoes,** lace up. Style: oxford, brogue, or blucher.
      Surprisingly, it has been years since I owned a lace-up pair of
      dress shoes.

    - **Casual shoes** like these styles by
      [Allbirds](https://www.allbirds.com): Tree Dasher, Tree Runners,
      Tree Pipers, Tree Skippers, Canvas Pacers. Any color *except*
      orange, yellow, purple, pink, white.

- **Semi-automatic "bug" Morse code key.** This is probably the Morse
  code thing that I most want to try out next. Such as these Vibroplex
  models: Original Standard $250, Original Standard Upgraded $270,
  Blue Racer Standard $240, [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com).
  These can be found used, too.

- **Single lever paddle** for Morse code.

    - search [gigaparts.com](https://www.gigaparts.com) for "single
      paddle", about $43.
    
    - Bencher ST-1. $150. [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com). This
      is supposedly a lovely one to use.
    
    - Vibrokeyer Standard. $180.
      [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com)
    
    - Begali "simplex mono basic" or "simplex mono",
      [i2rtf.com](https://i2rtf.com). These are pricey.

- Some kind of short sleeve **polo shirt**, *not* all-cotton,
  lightweight. Probably solid color. OK brands: Izod, Under Armour,
  Adidas. The kind I like are often sold as "golf performance wicking
  something something."

- **Short sleeve button-front** shirt, casual, all cotton. Usually
    size large.






# Medium priority

Many of these are very fun, but either I don't "need" them, or I would
use them but not all that often. I would be very happy to receive any
of them!

- **Old-timey "straight key"** for Morse code. Search eBay for "navy
  flameproof" or "vintage straight key." J-38 key is another classic
  style. Ideally get one that has all or most of the parts. (Don't buy
  just the knob, or a key without the knob. Key and knob without the
  base is okay. Without wires is pretty much okay.) These are fun
  gifts because it almost doesn't matter what kind you buy. They are
  all different, and they all will work (almost impossible to be
  broken or defective) and all will be fun!

- All items on the [Amazon
list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1O7VAQKRPMITU) are
"approved by me" and look like they would work, if you are not sure
about buying the "right" thing from the list above. Any of the
**Kindle books** on that list. Completely fine to get any of these as
a paper book, too (including used)!

- Any **short sleeve shirt from Criquet**,
  [criquetshirts.com](https://criquetshirts.com), around $90. Size:
  medium.

- New **belt**. Brown or black leather, for work. Simple design
  without a lot of stitching or decoration. Strap has to be 36 inches
  to fit correctly with enough leeway.

- **Belt**, casual. Has to be **lightweight** (no heavy metal buckle,
  no wide or thick leather). Any material for the strap is OK. Mostly
  for wearing with shorts. Lots more colors and designs are
  acceptable.

- Probably too crazy of an idea, but: Banjo ukulele? Mandolin? Bass
  clarinet?

- **Men's suit.** Could be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing
  that I would shop for myself but am not sure where)

- DeWalt **pressure washer,** $300. Like model DWPW2100
