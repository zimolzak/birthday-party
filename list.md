AJZ (not Alex) Wish list, as of 2023-06-21

# High priority

These are things I would start using right away and keep using a lot,
possibly daily.

- **Sandals**: slightly dressy, for outdoors, similar to my current
  ones, which are from L.L. Bean. Dark leather strap. No strap on the
  heel. The kind that go between big toe and 2nd toe, *not* the kind
  that go all the way over the instep. See example:

![example of flip-flops I like](/birthday-party/flipflop.jpg)

- **Shoes** for work/office. Dark brown leather. Slip on. Mostly
  dressy. Could be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing that I
  would shop for myself).

- **Casual shoes** like these styles by
  [Allbirds](https://www.allbirds.com): Tree Dasher, Tree Runners,
  Tree Pipers, Tree Skippers, Canvas Pacers. Any color *except*
  orange, yellow, purple, pink, white. Or just send me to their store
  in our neighborhood.

- **Mosrse code electronic gizmos**

    - [gigaparts.com](https://gigaparts.com) sells "Scout CPO," $50. A
      code practice oscillator is literally just a speaker that goes
      "boop," to practice using any Morse code key.

    - MFJ-557, $70. Also a code practice oscillator, but has a key
    attached, so maybe not as useful as one that is "just" a speaker
    box by itself. Buy from
    [mfjenterprises.com](https://mfjenterprises.com), not Amazon.

    - MFJ-419 "CW Elmer," $170. Portable gizmo that also interprets
      what you send and makes up random letters for you to copy.

    - CW Hotline from [Ham Radio
      Solutions](https://www.hamradio.solutions). This lets you sit
      anywhere and send Morse code using your radio that sits at home.
      Probably okay with kit *or* fully assembled.

    - K45B CW Modem from [K1EL Systems](https://www.k1elsystems.com).
      Type on a keyboard and out comes Morse code letters to your
      radio. Listens to your radio and displays the Morse code that it
      hears. No computer required.

- **Single lever paddle** for Morse code.
    - search [gigaparts.com](https://www.gigaparts.com) for "single paddle", $43
    - Bencher ST-1 $150, [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com)
    - Vibrokeyer Standard $180, [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com)
    - Begali "simplex mono basic" or "simplex mono", [i2rtf.com](https://i2rtf.com)

- **Jeans**, waist 34, length 32, Levi's. Color: any dark blue or medium blue (not light wash):
    - 501 (button fly)
    - 505 (regular/straight)
    - 514 (classic straight)
    - *maybe* 541
    - maybe not 550 (relaxed)

- Maybe a different pair of **jeans** appropriate for casual days at
  work? Colors like dark grey, dark olive, brown, tan/khaki.

- **Old-timey "straight key"** for Morse code. Search ebay for "navy
  flameproof" or "vintage straight key." Ideally get one that has all
  or most of the parts. (Don't buy just the knob, or a key without the
  knob. Key and knob without the base is okay. Without wires is
  probably okay.)

- New **belt**. Brown or black leather, for work. simple design
  without a lot of stitching or decoration. strap has to be 36 inches
  to fit correctly with enough leeway.

- **Belt**, casual. Has to be lightweight (can have a metal buckle,
  but not if it's a large metal buckle). Any material for the strap is
  OK. Mostly for wearing with shorts. Lots more colors and designs are
  acceptable.

- [https://www.danperri.com/book](https://www.danperri.com/book): an
  interesting-looking book from a famous movie title designer

- Some kind of **loop gizmo** for music. The idea is, I record one
  instrument bit, the machine plays it through a speaker, and then I
  play something along on a different instument. Maybe what's called a
  "looper pedal" but I'm not sure. Got to be self-contained and as
  simple as possible (if I have to break out my laptop each time and
  connect it, I will never use it). Maybe speaker included? Should be
  able to record several minutes if needed.

- **Necktie,** solid colors, dark generally, made of silk. I want a
  few in the "skinny" style, like 2 inches wide, without much
  "tapering" as it goes from the bottom to the top. Possibly with a
  blunt, rectangle-type end, instead of coming to a point.

- **Tie clip,** a cool, classy style, so it doesn't flop forward and
  drag on things if I bend over. Doesn't have to be literally made of
  a precious metal. Either a "plain" one, or something with a fun but
  subtle motif: pattern, texture, my monogram. Cool shapes: anchor,
  key, whale, Rod of Asclepius. Especially something that is a
  "frieze" pattern (just do an image search for 'frieze pattern').

- **Dress shirts,** probably Brooks Brothers, generally light weight.
  Get button-down collar. Probably mostly solid colors. I am running
  low, surprisingly. Size 16 (or maybe 17?) / 34.

- **Jaguar XK8**, but not the real car, a scale model :). Preferably
  green. Possibly one of the "display" models that's die cast, like
  those made by Maisto. Or literally a Hot Wheels.




## Already on Amazon list

All items on the Amazon list are "approved by me" and look like they
would work, if you are not sure about buying the "right" thing from
the list above.

- A long, narrow **strip of cork** that can go on a wall and be hung
  up with nails. Should have: some kind of frame (like aluminum),
  about 4--6 feet long and 1--2 inch wide. Ideally with two little
  attached eyelets for the nails to hold it to the wall.

- **NanoVNA antenna analyzer.** This lets me see how well radio
  antennas are set up, especially small, temporary ones.

- **GMRS handheld radios.** Search for "UV-5G" or "UV-5R GMRS." Lets
  several people in one family share one license to talk on certain
  frequencies.

- Any of the **Kindle books** on that list.




# Medium priority

- **Fix up bass guitar.** The middle potentiometer has always been
  weird and turns too far around. Some things seem intermittently not
  connected to the right pickups. Pay for somebody to check and repair
  (Rockin' Robin on Greenbriar in Houston is pretty close to us).
  Include: cheap soft "gig bag" for bass, probaby $30--40.

- Any **short sleeve shirt from Criquet**,
  [criquetshirts.com](https://criquetshirts.com), around $90

- **QCX-mini kit**, which is a little tiny radio that you build. Get
  it for the **40m band**. $55. Yes, the kit, not the assembled
  version. [qrp-labs.com](https://qrp-labs.com)

- Radio **antenna,** MFJ-1982MP. This lets me talk on some frequencies
  that I have never used so far, and it can be easily taken somewhere,
  set up temporarily, and taken down again. $100 on [mfjenterprises.com](https://mfjenterprises.com)

- **Semi-automatic "bug" Morse code key.** Such as vibroplex original
  standard, $220. [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com)

- **Men's suit.** Could be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing
  that I would shop for myself but am not sure where)

- **Armoire:** to hold light jackets, lots of small kids' coats, hats.
  Probably 2 hanging rods, or with drawers inside? Not too heavy. For
  front entryway or near back door. Probably need to check about size.

- I slightly want a **bike with electric assist motor.** *Consumer
  Reports* has a list that I can show you. [Example link](https://ebikeescape.com/flyer-l885-cargo-ebike-review/)

- Book, *Clinical Research Informatics* Third Edition, edited by
  Richesson, Andrews, and Hollis.
