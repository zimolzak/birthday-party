[here](/birthday-party/list-kid.html) for Alex list.

# High priority, clothing

These are things I would start using right away and keep using a lot,
possibly daily.

- **Dress shirts** (I need long sleeve more than short sleeve)
    - brand: Brooks Brothers, (sometimes L.L. Bean)
    - fabric: generally light weight. (So usually anything *except* Oxford cloth. Pinpoint Oxford is sometimes OK.)
    - style: Get button-down collar.
    - color: mostly solid
    - Fit: not "slim" but usually "the one that is a little looser than slim." Many call this "Regular" fit. Not "relaxed"
    - size: 17 neck / 34 sleeve.

- Any **short sleeve shirt from Criquet**,
  [criquetshirts.com](https://criquetshirts.com), around $90. Size:
  medium. Now *free shipping* on all orders with code: FALLSHIP

- Some kind of short sleeve **polo shirt**, *not* all-cotton,
  lightweight. Probably solid color. I have one from Izod that I like.
  Also Under Armour. The kind I like are often sold as "golf
  performance wicking something something."

- **Short sleeve button-front** shirt, casual, all cotton.

- **Necktie,** solid colors, dark generally, made of silk. I want a
  few in the "skinny" style, like 2 inches wide, without much
  "tapering" as it goes from the bottom to the top. Possibly with a
  blunt, rectangle-type end, instead of coming to a point.

- **Tie clip,** a cool, classy style, so my tie doesn't flop forward
  and drag on things if I bend over. Doesn't have to be literally made
  of a precious metal. Don't get the kind with a pin that pierces
  through things. Style ideas: plain metal, fun but subtle pattern,
  texture, my monogram, anchor, key, whale, rod of Asclepius, frieze
  pattern (do an image search for 'frieze pattern').

- New **belt**. Brown or black leather, for work. simple design
  without a lot of stitching or decoration. strap has to be 36 inches
  to fit correctly with enough leeway.

- **Belt**, casual. Has to be **lightweight** (no heavy metal buckle,
  no wide or thick leather). Any material for the strap is OK. Mostly
  for wearing with shorts. Lots more colors and designs are
  acceptable.

- **Jeans**, waist 34, length 32, Levi's. Color: any dark blue or
    medium blue (not light wash):

    - 501 (button fly)
    - 505 (regular/straight)
    - 514 (classic straight)
    - *maybe* 541
    - probably not 550 (relaxed)

- Maybe a non-blue pair of **jeans** appropriate for casual days at
  work? Colors like dark grey, dark olive, brown, tan/khaki.

- Footwear, size 10

    - **Sandals**: slightly dressy, for outdoors, similar to my
      current ones, which are from L.L. Bean. Dark leather strap. No
      strap on the heel. The kind that go between big toe and 2nd toe,
      *not* the kind that go all the way over the instep. See example:
      ![example of flip-flops I like](/birthday-party/flipflop.jpg)

    - **Shoes** for work/office. Dark brown leather. Slip on. Size 10.
      Mostly dressy. Could be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing
      that I would shop for myself).

    - **Shoes,** lace up. Style: oxford, brogue, or blucher.
      Surprisingly, it has been years since I owned a lace-up pair of
      work shoes.

    - **Casual shoes** like these styles by
      [Allbirds](https://www.allbirds.com): Tree Dasher, Tree Runners,
      Tree Pipers, Tree Skippers, Canvas Pacers. Any color *except*
      orange, yellow, purple, pink, white. Or just send me to their
      store in our neighborhood.




# High priority, not clothing

Same deal: these are all things that I would get a lot of use out of.

- Nintendo Switch?? Around $300.

- Any battery-powered **wristwatch** with a chronograph (stopwatch)
  built-in. Seiko or Timex are reasonable. Not fancy.

- **Old-timey "straight key"** for Morse code. Search ebay for "navy
  flameproof" or "vintage straight key." Ideally get one that has all
  or most of the parts. (Don't buy just the knob, or a key without the
  knob. Key and knob without the base is okay. Without wires is
  probably okay.) These are fun gifts because it almost doesn't matter
  what kind you buy. They are all different, and they all will work
  and be interesting to try!

- **Morse code electronic gizmos**

    - K45B CW Modem from [K1EL Systems](https://www.k1elsystems.com).
      Type on a keyboard and out comes Morse code letters to your
      radio. Listens to your radio and displays the Morse code that it
      hears. No computer required. $239.

    - MFJ-419 "CW Elmer," $170. Portable gizmo for Morse code
      practice. It interprets what you send and makes up random
      letters for you to copy.

    - CW Hotline from [Ham Radio
      Solutions](https://www.hamradio.solutions). This lets you sit
      anywhere and send Morse code using your radio that sits at home.
      Probably okay with kit *or* fully assembled. $55--105.

    - [gigaparts.com](https://gigaparts.com) sells "Scout CPO," $50. A
      code practice oscillator is literally just a speaker that goes
      "boop," to practice using any Morse code key.

- **Single lever paddle** for Morse code.

    - search [gigaparts.com](https://www.gigaparts.com) for "single
      paddle", about $43.
    
    - Bencher ST-1. $150. [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com). This
      is supposedly a lovely one to use.
    
    - Vibrokeyer Standard. $180. [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com)
    
    - Begali "simplex mono basic" or "simplex mono",
      [i2rtf.com](https://i2rtf.com). These are pricey.

- [https://www.danperri.com/book](https://www.danperri.com/book): an
  interesting-looking book from a famous movie title designer

- Some kind of **loop gizmo** for music. The idea is, I record one
  instrument bit, the machine plays it through a speaker, and then I
  play something along on a different instrument. Maybe what's called
  a "looper pedal" but I'm not sure. Got to be self-contained and as
  simple as possible (if I have to break out my laptop each time and
  connect it, I will never use it). Maybe speaker included? Should be
  able to record several minutes if needed.

- **Jaguar XK8**, but not the real car, a scale model :). Preferably
  green. Possibly one of the "display" models that's die cast, like
  those made by Maisto. Or literally a Hot Wheels.

# High priority but already on Amazon list

All items on the Amazon list are "approved by me" and look like they
would work, if you are not sure about buying the "right" thing from
the list above.

- A long, narrow **strip of cork** that can go on a wall and be hung
  up with nails. Should have: some kind of frame (like aluminum),
  about 4--6 feet long and 1--2 inch wide. Ideally with two little
  attached eyelets for the nails to hold it to the wall. I would use
  this for hanging up things that make me happy on our wall at home,
  without adding tape or holes to the walls

- **NanoVNA antenna analyzer.** This lets me see how well radio
  antennas are set up, especially small, temporary ones.

- **GMRS handheld radios.** Search for "UV-5G" or "UV-5R GMRS." Lets
  several people in one family share one license to talk on certain
  frequencies.

- Any of the **Kindle books** on that list. Completely fine to get any
  of these as a paper book, too (including used)!




# Medium priority

Many of these are very fun, but either I don't "need" them, or I would
use them but not all that often. I would be very happy to receive any
of them!

- **Fix up bass guitar.** The middle potentiometer has always been
  weird and turns too far around. Some things seem intermittently not
  connected to the right pickups. Pay for somebody to check and repair
  (Rockin' Robin on Greenbriar in Houston is pretty close to us).
  Include: cheap soft "gig bag" for bass, probably $30--40.

- **QCX-mini kit**, which is a little tiny radio that you build. Get
  it for the **40m band**. $55. Yes, the kit, not the assembled
  version. [qrp-labs.com](https://qrp-labs.com)

- Radio **antenna,** MFJ-1982MP. This lets me talk on some frequencies
  that I have never used so far, and it can be easily taken somewhere,
  set up temporarily, and taken down again. $100 on
  [mfjenterprises.com](https://mfjenterprises.com)

- **Semi-automatic "bug" Morse code key.** Such as vibroplex original
  standard. $220. [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com)

- **Men's suit.** Could be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing
  that I would shop for myself but am not sure where)

- I slightly want a **bike with electric assist motor.** *Consumer
  Reports* has a list that I can show you. [Example
  link](https://ebikeescape.com/flyer-l885-cargo-ebike-review/)

- Book, *Clinical Research Informatics* Third Edition, edited by
  Richesson, Andrews, and Hollis. [publisher
  link](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-27173-1)

- Cuisinart Cleanburn Firepit, $250.

- DeWalt pressure washer, $300. Like model DWPW2100
