AJZ (not Alex) Wish list, as of December 7, 2024. Go
[here](/birthday-party/list-kid.html) for Alex list.

# High priority

These are things I would start using right away and keep using a lot,
possibly daily. Arranged in no particular order inside this section.

- Photo developing of several rolls of 35mm film! I think [Indie Film
  Lab](https://www.indiefilmlab.com/) looks good. I would get *Process
  & Scan,* C41, 35mm, Noritsu scanner, resolution L, change to
  Uncorrected, file type JPG. This is $12 per roll.

- Trip to [Lone Star Flight Museum](https://lonestarflight.org/), or
  if you're feeling fancy, a ride in one of their historic airplanes.

- **The ARRL Antenna Book, 25th edition,** hardcover. The version that
  comes all as one volume (not softcover, not 4-volume set). $80. Main
  ARRL store link [here](https://home.arrl.org/action/Shop/Store).
  Direct [link to Antenna
  Book](https://home.arrl.org/action/Store/Product-Details/productId/2012451093).
  For some reason hardcover no longer available?

- **Necktie or bowtie with repeating pattern of small logos**.
    Preferably made of silk, and with embroidered logos, but those
    aren't requirements. Logos of any of the following schools:
    - Spartan helmet for MSU.
    - Block S letter for MSU: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/msu.jpg" alt="MSU tie" width="100"/>
    - The shield logo for Washington University in St. Louis: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/wu.jpg" alt="WUStL tie" width="100"/>
    - Block H letter for Harvard (sometimes inside a shield, technically their athletic logo).
    - Plain "Veritas" shield for Harvard: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hu-b1.jpg" alt="Harvard bowtie" width="100"/> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hu-b2.jpg" alt="Harvard bowtie, striped" width="100"/> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hu-n1.jpg" alt="Harvard tie, striped" width="100"/> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hu-n2.jpg" alt="Harvard tie" width="100"/>
    - Shield with lion rampant for Harvard medical: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hm-b.jpg" alt="HMS bowtie" width="100"/> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hm-n.jpg" alt="HMS tie" width="100"/>

- **Necktie,** solid green, black, grey, brown. Made of silk. Get
  "skinny" style, like 2 inches wide, without much "tapering" as it
  goes from the bottom to the top. Possibly with a blunt,
  rectangle-type end, instead of coming to a point.

- **Tie clip,** a cool, classy style, so my tie doesn't flop forward
  and drag on things if I bend over. Doesn't have to be literally made
  of a precious metal. Don't get the kind with a pin that pierces
  through things. Style ideas: fun but subtle pattern, texture, my
  monogram, anchor, key, rod of Asclepius, frieze pattern (do an image
  search for 'frieze pattern').

- Footwear, size 10

    - **Shoes** for work/office. Dark brown leather. Slip on. Size 10.
      Mostly dressy. Could be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing
      that I would shop for myself).

    - **Shoes,** lace up. Style: oxford, brogue, or blucher.
      Surprisingly, it has been years since I owned a lace-up pair of
      dress shoes.

    - **Casual shoes** like these styles by
      [Allbirds](https://www.allbirds.com): Tree Dasher, Tree Runners,
      Tree Pipers, Tree Skippers, Canvas Pacers. Any color *except*
      orange, yellow, purple, pink, white.

- **Old-timey "straight key"** for Morse code. Search eBay for "navy
  flameproof" or "vintage straight key." J-38 key is another classic
  style. Ideally get one that has all or most of the parts. (Don't buy
  just the knob, or a key without the knob. Key and knob without the
  base is okay. Without wires is pretty much okay.) These are fun
  gifts because it almost doesn't matter what kind you buy. They are
  all different, and they all will work (almost impossible to be
  broken or defective) and all will be fun!

- **Single lever paddle** for Morse code.

    - search [gigaparts.com](https://www.gigaparts.com) for "single
      paddle", about $43.
    
    - Bencher ST-1. $150. [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com). This
      is supposedly a lovely one to use.
    
    - Vibrokeyer Standard. $180.
      [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com)
    
    - Begali "simplex mono basic" or "simplex mono",
      [i2rtf.com](https://i2rtf.com). These are pricey.

- **Semi-automatic "bug" Morse code key.** Such as vibroplex original
  standard. $220. [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com)




## High priority but already on Amazon list

All items on the Amazon list are "approved by me" and look like they
would work, if you are not sure about buying the "right" thing from
the list above.

- Any of the **Kindle books** on that list. Completely fine to get any
  of these as a paper book, too (including used)!




# Medium priority

Many of these are very fun, but either I don't "need" them, or I would
use them but not all that often. I would be very happy to receive any
of them!

- Any **short sleeve shirt from Criquet**,
  [criquetshirts.com](https://criquetshirts.com), around $90. Size:
  medium. Now *free shipping* on all orders with code: FALLSHIP

- **Sandals**: slightly dressy, for outdoors, similar to my current
  ones, which are from L.L. Bean. Dark leather strap. No strap on the
  heel. The kind that go between big toe and 2nd toe, *not* the kind
  that go all the way over the instep. See example: ![example of
  flip-flops I like](/birthday-party/flipflop.jpg)

- Some kind of short sleeve **polo shirt**, *not* all-cotton,
  lightweight. Probably solid color. OK brands: Izod, Under Armour,
  Adidas. The kind I like are often sold as "golf performance wicking
  something something."

- **Short sleeve button-front** shirt, casual, all cotton.

- New **belt**. Brown or black leather, for work. simple design
  without a lot of stitching or decoration. strap has to be 36 inches
  to fit correctly with enough leeway.

- **Belt**, casual. Has to be **lightweight** (no heavy metal buckle,
  no wide or thick leather). Any material for the strap is OK. Mostly
  for wearing with shorts. Lots more colors and designs are
  acceptable.

- Tan/khaki colored (not blue) Levi 501 or 505 **jeans**, waist 34,
  length 30 (yes). Alternate colors: dark grey, dark olive, brown.

- **Fix up bass guitar.** The middle potentiometer has always been
  weird and turns too far around. Some things seem intermittently not
  connected to the right pickups. Pay for somebody to check and repair
  (Rockin' Robin on Greenbriar in Houston is pretty close to us).
  Include: cheap soft "gig bag" for bass, probably $30--40.

- Probably too crazy of an idea, but: Banjo ukulele? Mandolin? Bass
  clarinet?

- **Men's suit.** Could be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing
  that I would shop for myself but am not sure where)

- Book, *Clinical Research Informatics* Third Edition, edited by
  Richesson, Andrews, and Hollis. [publisher
  link](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-27173-1)

- DeWalt pressure washer, $300. Like model DWPW2100
