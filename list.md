AJZ (not Alex) Wish list, as of 2023-06-21

# High priority

## Not found on Amazon list

- **Sandals**: slightly dressy, for outdoors, similar to my current
  ones, which are from L.L. Bean. Ask for a pic, or maybe I will post
  one soon. Dark leather strap. No strap on the heel. The kind that go
  between big toe and 2nd toe, not the kind that go all the way over
  the instep.

- **Shoes** for work/office. Dark brown leather. Slip on. Mostly
  dressy. Could be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing that I
  would shop for myself).

- **Pillow:** New pillow for bed. Not too thick or firm. Regular poly
  stuff fill, not feathers, not memory foam.

- **Single lever paddle** for morse code.
    - search gigaparts.com for "single paddle", $43
    - Bencher ST-1 $150, vibroplex.com
    - Vibrokeyer Standard $180, vibroplex.com
    - Begali "simplex mono basic" or "simplex mono", i2rtf.com

- **Jeans**, waist 34, length 32, Levi's:
    - 501 (button fly)
    - 505 (regular/straight)
    - 514 (classic straight)
    - *maybe* 541
    - maybe not 550 (relaxed)

- **QCX-mini kit**, which is a little tiny radio that you build. Get
  it for the **40m band**. $55. Yes, the kit, not the assembled
  version. qrp-labs.com





## Already on Amazon list

All items on the Amazon list are "approved by me" and look like they
would work, if you are not sure about buying the "right" thing from
the list above.

- **Security camera monitor/recorder** to test out the security
  cameras in our house. Mostly needs to have BNC video in and should
  have HDMI out.

- **NanoVNA antenna analyzer.** This lets me see how well radio
  antennas are set up, especially small, temporary ones.

- **GMRS handheld radios.** Search for "UV-5G" or "UV-5R GMRS." Lets
  several people in one family share one license to talk on certain
  frequencies.

- Any of the **Kindle books** on that list.




# Medium priority

- Any **short sleeve shirt from criquetshirts.com,** around $90

- **Code practice oscillator** for morse code.

    - gigaparts.com sells "Scout CPO," $50

    - MFJ-557, $70. Probably not as useful as one that is "just" a
    speaker box by itself. Buy from mfjenterprises.com, not Amazon.

- **Semi-automatic "bug" morse code key.** Such as vibroplex original
  standard, $220. vibroplex.com

- **Men's suit.** Could be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing
  that I would shop for myself but am not sure where)

- **Armoire:** to hold light jackets, lots of small kids' coats, hats.
  Probably 2 hanging rods, or with drawers inside? Not too heavy. For
  front entryway or near back door. Probably need to check about size.

- I slightly want a **bike with electric assist motor.**
