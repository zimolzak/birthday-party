AJZ (not Alex) Wish list, as of 2023-06-16

# High priority

## Not found on Amazon list


- Sandals: slightly dressy, for outdoors, similar to my current ones, which are from L.L. Bean. Ask for a pic, or maybe I will post one soon. 
  Dark leather strap. No strap on the heel. The kind that go between
  big toe and 2nd toe, not the kind that go all the way over the
  instep.

- work/office shoes. Dark brown leather. Slip on. Mostly dressy. Could
  be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing that I would shop for
  myself).

- new pillow for bed. not too thick or firm. regular poly stuff fill,
  not feathers, not memory foam.

- Single lever paddle for morse code.
    - search gigaparts.com for "single paddle", $43
    - Bencher ST-1 $150, vibroplex.com
    - Vibrokeyer Standard $180, vibroplex.com
    - Begali "simplex mono basic" or "simplex mono", i2rtf.com

- Jeans, waist 34, length 32, Levi's:
    - 501 (button fly)
    - 505 (regular/straight)
    - 514 (classic straight)
    - *maybe* 541
    - maybe not 550 (relaxed)


- QCX-mini kit, 40m band, $55. Yes, the kit, not the assembled
  version. qrp-labs.com

- small tent for 2-person backyard camping. Fair warning: **someone is already considering buying this gift.** Get something *not* super cheap. It should be able to withstand mild rain and wind. Buying something brand-name would be reasonable. Not a toy tent. Don't buy the top-of-the line $700 item designed for ultra-lightweight backpacking or to withstand blizzards, etc.




## Already on Amazon list

All items on the Amazon list are "approved by me" and look like they
would work, if you are not sure about buying the "right" thing from
the list above.

- A monitor/recorder to test out the security cameras in our house.
  Mostly needs to have BNC video in and should have HDMI out.

- NanoVNA antenna analyzer. This lets me see how well radio antennas
  are set up, especially small, temporary ones.

- GMRS handheld radios. Search for "UV-5G" or "UV-5R GMRS." Lets
  several people in one family share one license to talk on certain
  frequencies.

- any of the kindle books on that list. 




# Medium priority

- any short sleeve shirt from criquetshirts.com, around $90

- "code practice oscillator" for morse code.

    - gigaparts.com sells "Scout CPO," $50

    - MFJ-557, $70. Probably not as useful as one that is "just" a
    speaker box by itself. Buy from mfjenterprises.com, not Amazon.

- semi-automatic "bug" morse code key. Such as vibroplex original
standard, $220. vibroplex.com

- men's suit. Could be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing that I
  would shop for myself but am not sure where)

- armoire that will hold light jackets, lots of small kids' coats,
  hats. Probably 2 hanging rods, or with drawers inside? Not too
  heavy. For front entryway or near back door. Probably need to check about size.
