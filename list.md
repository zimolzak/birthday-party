# AJZ (not Alex) Wish List

As of November 18, 2025

- Go [here](/birthday-party/list-kid.html) for Alex list.
- Go [here](/birthday-party/list-eam.html) for E.A.M. list.



# High priority

These are things I would start using right away and keep using a lot,
possibly daily.

## Books

Go to your local indie bookstore or something! It's not necessary to
buy from Amazon, but that's okay, too. I slightly prefer print edition
to an e-reader edition.

- **Merriam-Webster's** Collegiate Dictionary twelfth edition.
  Available November 18! Yeah, again, seriously. I want this
  particular dictionary and edition. It's going to delight me.

- Tim Berners Lee: *This Is for Everyone.*

- R.\ F.\ Kuang: *Katabasis.*

- Christine Wenc: *Funny Because It's True: How the Onion Created
  Modern News Satire.*



## Nerd

- [x] A new antenna for my ham radio. About $90--100. I don't yet know
  exactly what happened to the old one, but it doesn't work right any
  more. The old one was a **MFJ-2010** off-center-fed dipole (OCFD)
  for 40, 20, 10, and 6 meters. Worked great for years. I think I
  would love another one. Of course, I am also looking for an end-fed
  half wave (EFHW). Mostly I want to be on the bands that I listed
  above (40 20 10 6), but if you get an EFHW, I would be interested in
  80 meters, too.

- **Air compressor.** Yes, I want to blast out certain drainage lines,
  and also it can hook to a rapid can crusher maybe? Kind of want to
  inflate tires occasionally. I can give you a list of several
  recommended ones, or just like buy one that is for regular,
  non-professional people and not gigantic capacity or pressure.

- **Photo developing** of several (ten?) rolls of 35mm film! I think
  [Indie Film Lab](https://www.indiefilmlab.com/) looks good. I would
  get *Process & Scan,* C41, 35mm, Noritsu scanner, resolution L,
  change to Uncorrected, file type JPG. This is $12 per roll. (I have
  6 rolls to do.)

- **Trip to [Lone Star Flight Museum](https://lonestarflight.org/),**
  or if you're feeling fancy, a ride in one of their historic
  airplanes.

- Cotton T-shirt, size large, with **school logo or name** of places
  I've attended. *See neckties below* for which schools. Keep it
  simple, such as: just one big MSU spartan helmet logo in white on a
  green shirt, or block letters "MICHIGAN STATE" in green on black,
  *etc.* Background colors: grey, black, blue, green, red.

- [x] **The ARRL Antenna Book, 25th edition,** hardcover. The version
  that comes all as one volume (not softcover, not 4-volume set). $80.
  Main ARRL store link
  [here](https://home.arrl.org/action/Shop/Store). Direct [link to
  Antenna
  Book](https://home.arrl.org/action/Store/Product-Details/productId/2012451093).
  For some reason hardcover no longer available?

- Wireless doorbell that has *volume adjustment!*

- Very long tree trimmer. Either a manual type (with a saw and shears,
  plus a rope that you pull), or battery-powered saw cutter.



## Clothes

- **Wallet.** Some type of wallet that doesn't fold and is a little
    thinner than the one I have now. Maybe made of fabric or something
    other than leather. Should have at least 3 slots (a few cards, a
    few other cards, and cash folded in half). More slots are OK but
    no more than 6, I guess. These are sometimes sold as "card holder"
    type wallets. Bifold may be OK if skinny enough, but no trifold.
    Most colors are OK. (black, brown, tan, grey, tan: in solid or
    pattern. Or even fun designs like that Simpsons one I used to
    have.)

- A new **"clickabelt."** Belt made by "Slidebelts." Something like a
  brown leather belt. The one I've had for a while is getting worn.
  Should be at least 36 inch strap. Often they are sold with
  extra-long straps, and you cut them to length.

- **Necktie or bowtie with repeating pattern of small logos**.
    Preferably made of silk, and with embroidered logos, but those
    aren't requirements. Logos of any of the following schools:
    - Spartan helmet for MSU: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/msu.jpg" alt="MSU tie" width="100"/>
    - Block S letter for MSU.
    - The shield logo for Washington University in St. Louis: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/wu.jpg" alt="WUStL tie" width="100"/>
    - Block H letter for Harvard (sometimes inside a shield, technically their athletic logo).
    - Plain "Veritas" shield for Harvard: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hu-b1.jpg" alt="Harvard bowtie" width="100"/> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hu-b2.jpg" alt="Harvard bowtie, striped" width="100"/> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hu-n1.jpg" alt="Harvard tie, striped" width="100"/> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hu-n2.jpg" alt="Harvard tie" width="100"/>
    - Shield with lion rampant for Harvard medical: <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hm-b.jpg" alt="HMS bowtie" width="100"/> <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="/birthday-party/ties/hm-n.jpg" alt="HMS tie" width="100"/>
    - Mizzou
    - Saint Louis University

- **Necktie,** solid green, black, grey, brown. Made of silk. Get
  "skinny" style, like 2 inches wide, without much "tapering" as it
  goes from the bottom to the top. Possibly with a blunt,
  rectangle-type end, instead of coming to a point.

- **Tie clip,** a cool, classy style, so my tie doesn't flop forward
  and drag on things if I bend over. Doesn't have to be literally made
  of a precious metal. Don't get the kind with a pin that pierces
  through things. Style ideas: fun but subtle pattern, texture, my
  monogram, anchor, key, rod of Asclepius, frieze pattern (do an image
  search for 'frieze pattern').



# Medium priority

Many of these are very fun, but either I don't "need" them, or I would
use them but not all that often. I would be very happy to receive any
of them!

## Clothes

- **Short sleeve button-front** shirt, casual, all cotton. Usually
  size large. Especially Brooks Brothers regular fit (blue label) with
  button-down collar.

- Any **short sleeve shirt from Criquet**,
  [criquetshirts.com](https://criquetshirts.com), around $90. Size:
  medium.

- **Men's suit.** Could be "gift card situation" (the kind of thing
  that I would shop for myself but am not sure where)

- Some kind of short sleeve **polo shirt**, *not* all-cotton,
  lightweight. Probably solid color. OK brands: Izod, Under Armour,
  Adidas. The kind I like are often sold as "golf performance wicking
  something something."

## Other

- Video games for PS5
    - Gran Turismo 7
    - MLB The Show 25
    - Halo: Campaign Evolved
    - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle

- **Old-timey "straight key"** for Morse code. Search eBay for "navy
  flameproof" or "vintage straight key." J-38 key is another classic
  style. Ideally get one that has all or most of the parts. (Don't buy
  just the knob, or a key without the knob. Key and knob without the
  base is okay. Without wires is pretty much okay.) These are fun
  gifts because it almost doesn't matter what kind you buy. They are
  all different, and they all will work (almost impossible to be
  broken or defective) and all will be fun!

- All items on the [Amazon
  list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1O7VAQKRPMITU) are
  "approved by me" and look like they would work, if you are not sure
  about buying the "right" thing from the list above. Any of the
  **Kindle books** on that list. Completely fine to get any of these
  as a paper book, too (including used)!

- Probably too crazy of an idea, but: Banjo ukulele? Mandolin? Bass
  clarinet?

- DeWalt **pressure washer,** $300. Like model DWPW2100. Yeah, I kinda
  still would use this.

- **Semi-automatic "bug" Morse code key.** This is probably the Morse
  code thing that I most want to try out next. Such as these Vibroplex
  models: Original Standard $250, Original Standard Upgraded $270,
  Blue Racer Standard $240, [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com).
  These can be found used, too.

- **Single lever paddle** for Morse code.

    - search [gigaparts.com](https://www.gigaparts.com) for "single
      paddle", about $43.

    - Bencher ST-1. $150. [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com). This
      is supposedly a lovely one to use.

    - Vibrokeyer Standard. $180.
      [vibroplex.com](https://vibroplex.com)

    - Begali "simplex mono basic" or "simplex mono",
      [i2rtf.com](https://i2rtf.com). These are pricey.
