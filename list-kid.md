Alex wish list, as of November 9, 2023.

- Almost any "adopt an animal" with plush figurine from [World
  Wildlife Fund](https://gifts.worldwildlife.org/gift-center/gifts/Species-Adoptions.aspx?sort=2).
  Note! This works for Elizabeth too, especially for cute marine
  mammals.

- VTech "KidiZoom Smartwatch" kids'
  [wristwatch](https://www.vtechkids.com/product/detail/20103/KidiZoom_Smartwatch_DX3)
  with camera.

- a paper diary

- [This](https://www.squishable.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=mini_plague_doctor_7)
    cute creature from squishable.com, which Alex thinks looks like an
    owl, and which he refers to as "Hootsy."

- a countdown timer to put on the wall, with remote control

- wallet with a cute design on it

- [Duolingo](https://store.duolingo.com/products/duo-plushie) plushie

- Anything that fits the description of "Remote Control Robot Dog
  Toy." Avoid things that connect to WiFi. *Caveat:* he already has a
  good number of remote control toys and tends to get bored with them.
