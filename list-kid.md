Alex wish list, **now updated, December 10, 2024.** Go
[here](/birthday-party/list.html) for his dad's list.




# List written by Alex

Alex has an [extensive list](https://www.thingstogetme.com/alex-wish)
of gift ideas that he put together himself. However, *be aware:* not
all of the items here are parent-approved. Alex knows this. He can add
things on his own and tries to keep it to things that are safe, but he
might not always think before adding. *Best to check with parents
first.*

Note: you can click "Reserve" if you are planning to get something
from that list, so he doesn't get 2 of the same present.

## Also, the following

- dimmable flashlight
- timer (for wall) with remote and multiple timers
- new *Bad Kitty* books (by Nick Bruel)---please consult grownups for which books he already owns.
- 1, 2, or 3 folders
- first aid things
- 2 rolls of stickers
