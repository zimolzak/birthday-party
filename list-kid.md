# Important notes from parents (what not to buy)

- Please don't buy any wheeled vehicles (cars, tricycles, karts,
  *etc.*) for a kid to ride on. We have a lot already! Alex is also
  riding a 2-wheeled bike now, so the others are less interesting now.

- Please don't buy anything with a laser in it.

- *Best to check with parents first* before buying most gifts.

- Here are some Lego sets that Alex **already owns.**

# Lists written by Alex

- Alex has an [extensive
list](https://www.thingstogetme.com/alex-wish) of gift ideas that he
put together himself. However, *be aware:* not all of the items here
are parent-approved. Alex knows this. He can add things on his own and
tries to keep it to things that are safe, but he might not always
think before adding items. (Note: you can click "Reserve" on the
Things to Get Me site if you are planning to buy something from that
list, so he doesn't get 2 of the same present.)
