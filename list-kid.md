Alex wish list, **now updated, December 10, 2024.** Go
[here](/birthday-party/list.html) for his dad's list.

# Important notes from parents

- Please don't buy any wheeled vehicles (cars, tricycles, karts,
  *etc.*) for a kid to ride on. We have a lot already! Alex is also
  riding a 2-wheeled bike now, so the others are less interesting now.

- Please don't buy anything with a laser in it.

- *Best to check with parents first* before buying most gifts.




# List written by Alex

Alex has an [extensive list](https://www.thingstogetme.com/alex-wish)
of gift ideas that he put together himself. However, *be aware:* not
all of the items here are parent-approved. Alex knows this. He can add
things on his own and tries to keep it to things that are safe, but he
might not always think before adding items.

Note: you can click "Reserve" on the Things to Get Me site if you are
planning to buy something from that list, so he doesn't get 2 of the
same present.

## Ideas from Alex, 2023

- dimmable flashlight
- timer (for wall) with remote and multiple timers
- new *Bad Kitty* books (by Nick Bruel)---please consult grownups for which books he already owns.
