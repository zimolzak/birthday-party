Home Depot has kids craft days on the first Saturday of every month.
Today we went to our second one.

The first craft project we made was a small whiteboard. (I can't
remember right now exactly when that was.) The whiteboard had mostly
wood parts, which I painted different colors. The middle part (for
writing on) was also wood with a special coating. It had mostly nails
and a few screws.

Today's project was a **pumpkin tic-tac-toe game.**

Here is the [link to
register](https://www.homedepot.com/c/kids-workshop) for future craft
events. So far, it looks like the next ones are:

- November 30, cocoa ornament
- December 7, 2024, Holiday Snow Globe
- January 4, 2025, Piggy Bank
- February 1, 2025, Valentines Candy Box

It is free to register! You might not even need to register ahead of
time. They do say to arrive early, though. The address where we went
is [5445 West Loop South.](https://osm.org/go/TuQSud1z7--?way=194663285)
