- **Dress shirts** (I need long sleeve more than short sleeve)
    - brand: Brooks Brothers, (sometimes L.L. Bean)
    - fabric: generally light weight. (So usually anything *except* Oxford cloth. Pinpoint Oxford is sometimes OK.)
    - style: Get button-down collar.
    - color: mostly solid
    - Fit: not "slim" but usually "the one that is a little looser than slim." Many call this "Regular" fit. Not "relaxed"
    - size: 17 neck / 34 sleeve.

- **Jeans**, waist 34, length 32, Levi's. Color: any dark blue or
    medium blue (not light wash):

    - 501 (button fly)
    - 505 (regular/straight)
    - 514 (classic straight)
    - *maybe* 541
    - probably not 550 (relaxed)

- **Morse code electronic gizmos**

    - OK, don't buy this first item. I got it for myself as a reward.
      Look further down the list. ~~K45B CW Modem from K1EL Systems~~

    - MFJ-419 "CW Elmer," $170. Portable gizmo for Morse code
      practice. It interprets what you send and makes up random
      letters for you to copy.

    - CW Hotline from [Ham Radio
      Solutions](https://www.hamradio.solutions). This lets you sit
      anywhere and send Morse code using your radio that sits at home.
      Probably okay with kit *or* fully assembled. $55--105.

    - [gigaparts.com](https://gigaparts.com) sells "Scout CPO," $50. A
      code practice oscillator is literally just a speaker that goes
      "boop," to practice using any Morse code key.
